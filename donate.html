                Your support is crucial to the success of The Giving Apple. Financial contributions help us cover operational costs, such as storage containers and transportation, and enable us to expand our reach in the community. In addition to financial support, we also welcome donations of non-perishable food items, such as canned goods and packaged snacks. Please ensure that the items are unopened and within their expiration date.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make a financial donation, please contact us at <a href="mailto:thegivingapple@lahs.org">thegivingapple@lahs.org</a> for more information.
