            While The Giving Apple primarily focuses on reducing food waste by collecting untouched food from our school's lunch line, we also support local food drives in their efforts to provide meals to those in need. If you are interested in donating to The Giving Apple, please consider donating to one of our partner food drives. Your support will help them provide meals

            If you would like to make a financial donation to The Giving Apple, please contact us at <a href="mailto:thegivingapple@lahs.org">thegivingapple@lahs.org</a> for more information.

            In addition to financial support, we also welcome donations of non-perishable food items, such as canned goods and packaged snacks. Please ensure that the items are unopened and within their expiration date. You can drop off your donations at Los Altos High School during school hours or contact us to arrange a pick-up.
