            <h2>About The Giving Apple</h2>
            <p>
                The Giving Apple is a club at Los Altos High School dedicated to reducing food waste and supporting our local community. We believe that no food should go to waste, especially when there are people in need. Our club members work together to collect untouched food from the school's lunch line and donate it to local food drives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission is not only to help those in need but also to raise awareness about the issue of food waste and its impact on the environment. By educating our peers and the wider community, we aim to create a more sustainable future for everyone.
