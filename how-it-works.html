        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>
            The Giving Apple follows a simple yet effective process to collect untouched food from the lunch line and donate it to local food drives. Our members are committed to ensuring the food is handled safely and reaches those in need.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>At the end of each lunch period, club members collect untouched food from the lunch line. This includes unopened packages, fruits, and other food items that can be safely consumed later.</li>
            <li>The collected food is properly stored and transported to our partner food drives. We maintain a high standard of hygiene and safety when handling the food.</li>
            <li>Our partner food drives distribute the food to those in need in our community, ensuring that it reaches people who can benefit from it and doesn't go to waste.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Our club members also participate in awareness campaigns and educational activities to promote the importance of reducing food waste and supporting our local community.
