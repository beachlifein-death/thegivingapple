            <h2>How it Works</h2>
            <p>
                The Giving Apple follows a simple yet effective process to collect untouched food from the lunch line and donate it to local food drives. Our members are committed to ensuring the food is handled safely and reaches those in need.
            </p>
           
            <p>
                Here's how our process works:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>At the end of the lunch period, club members collect untouched food items from the designated collection area.</li>
                <li>We carefully check the food to make sure it's safe for consumption and hasn't been contaminated.</li>
                <li>Food items are then sorted and packed in food-safe containers for transportation.</li>
                <li>We transport the collected food to local food drives, shelters, or organizations in need.</li>
                <li>Periodically, we organize events and initiatives to raise awareness about food waste and its impact on the environment and our community.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Our process ensures that we minimize food waste while providing nutritious meals to those in need. We are always looking for ways to improve our methods and expand our reach in the community.
